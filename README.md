## rosserial

This repo is ported from https://kforge.ros.org/rosserial/hg. It has been catkinized and updated for ROS Groovy and onward.

### Changes for Indigo and Onwards

Changes are being tracked on a per-package basis; please see the individual package folders,
or use the "Changes" link on the right side of the package pages on the ROS wiki.

### Changes for Hydro

0.5.5
 * Add support for Arduino Yum
 * Release rosserial_server

0.5.4
 * Fix a bug in string deserialization where part of length field could be uninitialized
(issues 74 & 76)

0.5.3
 * Add rosserial_server - a C++ server implementation
 * Fix misc bugs including adding fixes for alignment issues on ARM processors
0.5.2
 * Wire protocol change to add checksum to message length
 * Support empty requests
 * Re-integrate rosserial_xbee

### Changes for Groovy/Catkin

 * Moved to catkin build system 
 * Moved rosserial_xbee to experimential stack
 * Created new rosserial metapackage, with depends only on python, client and msgs.
 * Closed, integrated and/or moved all tickets to github.
 * New message generation and workflow:
   * no longer uses roslib.rospack, or roslib.gentools (and is way, WAY faster)
   * messages are no longer built at built-time (yeah, sounds ridiculous, but is true, see below for new workflow)
   * beginnings of easier porting to new platforms (the lookup table is now found in architecture-dependent packages, etc)

### Usage/Workflow

Please see the [rosserial Tutorials on the ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials) to get started.
