__usage__ = """
This generic make_libraries generates the non-platform specific part of a
rosserial client library, including messages. It assumes the target platform
has native float64 support, and is therefore unsuitable for use with AVR.
To generate messages for AVR, use the make_libraries script in
rosserial_arduino.

This script also does not provide the ros.h file or other hardware
abstraction. This will need to be supplied by the user.
